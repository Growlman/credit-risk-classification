# credit-risk-classification

#### In this Challenge, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

#### Please note, this is using the starter code provided in the slack channel, in case that is relevant later since the versions are different.
